             Paris is also the center of French economy, politics, traffic and                   culture. Paris has many art museums and historical buildings. As a                  traffic center, Paris has a very good underground subway system                     (called the Metro). It also has two airports. The Metro was built in               1900, and its total length is more than 200 km (120 mi).

              The city has a multi-cultural style, because 20% of the people there               are from outside France.[source?] There are many different                          restaurants with all kinds of food. Paris also has some types of                    pollution like air pollution and light pollution.

            Venice is built on millions of petrified logs that have been driven in            to the ground. These logs were mainly from Alder trees (known for its            water resistance). These were bought to Venice by boat from other                    countries such as Slovenia and Croatia.

             Grand Lake is Colorado's largest and deepest natural lake.[4] It is                 located in the headwaters of the Colorado River in Grand County,                    Colorado. On its north shore is located the historic and eponymous                  town of Grand Lake. The lake was formed during the Pinedale                         glaciation, which occurred from 30000 BP (before present) to 10000                  BP.[5] The glacial terminal moraine created a natural dam. <br>
                  Natural tributaries to the lake are the North Inlet and East                        Inlet, both of which flow out of Rocky Mountain National Park,                   whichsurrounds the lake on three sides. Grand Lake is located 1                   mile from the Park's western entrance. Grand Lake was named                   Spirit Lake by the Ute Tribe because they believed the lake's                   cold waters to be the dwelling place of departed souls.</p></td>

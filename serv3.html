     Accommodation is all about making room — it can mean a room or place where you      will stay or an agreement about sharing something.
     <br><br>
     If the only accommodation at Grandma's is the bunk bed and you and your sis      decide to take turns on the top, you've made an accommodation regarding your      accommodations. When you are accommodating someone, you are making room for      them or special circumstances for them. For example, the student with the      broken hand was granted the accommodation of having a scribe write his answers      for the test. Always remember that accommodation is an accommodating word —      there's room inside for two m's and two c's.

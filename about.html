             tourism-related marketing on the part of a private or public entity                 directed towards audiences abroad, and might target potential              travelers and non-travelers alike. Wholly private firms such as travel              agencies,hotel chains, cruise agencies, non-governmental organizations              (NGOs) often run their own advertising campaigns to market their               existence,mission, or services and/or goods offered to the consumer,               and these advertisements seldom carry intentional political messages.
                 <br><br>
                On the other hand, advertising distributed by governments                          themselves, such as through tourism ministries or government-owned                   private sector enterprises, is sometimes intended to convey more                 than simply the value of the product, service, or experience;                 governments can use tourism ads as a channel for communicating                 directly to the public of other countries because tourism is a                 common and internationally encouraged industry and the advertising                  of it is subject to minimal content regulation.<br><br>

                   As the global travel market continues to expand with yearly                         increasing flights among international destinations, advertising                    efforts on the part of the major actors in this market are also                     increasing. Advertising campaigns to promote travel to                    destinations abroad are particularly prevalent in western                    countries where the  general public's expenditures on tourism                    tend to be consistently high,even in light of the economic                    recession.
